# OSproject

buildNeuronTable.m compiles data from all the FOV movies into one giant neuronTable in Matlab that include all data and metadata

OSpropAndTuning.m & plotWvfs.m computes and plots results from figures 1 & 2

For modelling lines on retina:
Run modelEllipseUI.mlapp in Matlab (was done on Matlab 2022a)
  Will load dataOS_NRDRB2KO.mat once you tweak values in the app
  requires lineEllipse.m which we did NOT write (credit: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68619-lineellipse)
